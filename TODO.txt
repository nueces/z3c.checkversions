=========

- generate an updated versions.cfg for a buildout
- have a default verbose option which prints current versions as well
- make several network connection at once for faster detection
- handle network timeouts (abort at the end ?)
- use the egg name instead of the package name? (to avoid setuptools=0.6.12)
